### Color and Contrast

TL;DR <!-- .element: class="list-heading" -->
* Fail: Your text doesn't have enough contrast with the background. You probably want to make it darker. This is a score of less than 3.0.
* AA Large: The smallest acceptable amount of contrast for type sizes of 18pt and larger. This is a score of at least 3.0.
* AA: This is the sweet spot for text sizes below ~18pt. This is a score of at least 4.5.
* AAA: This is enhanced contrast with a score of at least 7.0. Think longer form articles that will be read for a significant period of time.
