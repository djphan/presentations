### Meaningful HTML Landmarks

* HTML elements are landmarks for screen reader technologies.
    * Hide unecessary elements from the screen reader if they are not needed for a non-visual experience
    * Provide non visual landmarks for non sighted users if it helps with HTML organization
    * Provide meaningful labels for existing elements for when things are unclear
